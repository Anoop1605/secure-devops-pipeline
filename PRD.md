# 2\. Executive Summary

Modern software teams have adopted CI/CD pipelines to ship code faster - but security has historically been an afterthought bolted on at the end, like installing an alarm system after a burglary. This structural disconnect means that vulnerabilities born in the developer's editor only surface after deployment, when the cost to fix them is estimated to be 30× higher than at the point of introduction.

SDOP-2025 solves this by treating every pipeline stage as a mandatory security gate. The analogy is an airport security model: passengers (code commits) must pass through multiple independent checkpoints (SAST, SCA, secret detection, IaC scanning, container hardening, policy enforcement, DAST) before boarding the flight (deployment). Any checkpoint failure grounds the flight immediately, with a clear report on what triggered the hold.

The project is built on a Java Spring Boot application - deliberately chosen because it mirrors real enterprise environments - and orchestrated through GitHub Actions / GitLab CI, Docker, and Kubernetes (Helm). Findings are centralised in DefectDojo and visualised via Grafana dashboards, giving both developers and auditors a single pane of glass for security posture.

Delivered by a four-member team in four weeks, SDOP-2025 demonstrates that shift-left security is not just a theoretical ideal but a concrete, reproducible engineering practice achievable at academic scale.

# 3\. Problem Statement & Motivation

## 3.1 Core Problem

Security in most CI/CD workflows exists as a final audit rather than a pipeline-native enforcement mechanism. Tools like SAST scanners and DAST proxies exist in isolation - they are not wired to block the pipeline, their output is not centralised, and feedback to developers arrives too late for low-cost remediation. The result is a systemic vulnerability introduction pattern: hardcoded credentials, CVE-laden dependencies, misconfigured Kubernetes manifests, and non-compliant container images all reach production before any security team reviews them.

## 3.2 Research-Identified Gaps

| **Gap**                          | **Explanation**                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tool Isolation**               | SAST, DAST, and SCA tools operate independently - no unified enforcement pipeline exists in most academic or small-team environments.        |
| **Late Vulnerability Detection** | Findings surface post-deployment where remediation cost is 30× higher than at the code-commit stage.                                         |
| **Missing Policy Gates**         | Few systems enforce automated pipeline blocking based on CVSS severity thresholds. Most generate reports that humans must manually act on.   |
| **Incomplete Coverage**          | Published research focuses on SAST/DAST only; IaC security, secret detection, container hardening, and policy-as-code are routinely absent.  |
| **Poor Feedback Loop**           | Developers receive no real-time, actionable feedback within their normal workflow, forcing high context-switch cost to act on findings.      |
| **Cost & Complexity**            | Enterprise DevSecOps platforms (Snyk Enterprise, Veracode) are prohibitively expensive and over-engineered for academic or startup contexts. |

## 3.3 Why This Problem Matters for Our Context

As CSE Cyber Security students, the pipeline we build represents exactly the kind of system we will be asked to design, audit, or extend in industry. A working SDOP-2025 demonstrates not just academic competency but practical engineering fluency across the DevSecOps stack - making it directly relevant to placement interviews, portfolio projects, and real-world assignments at companies like HPE, Atlassian, and Adobe.

# 4\. Project Objectives

The four primary objectives map directly to the four research gaps prioritised in the literature survey:

| **#** | **Objective**                                   | **Success Definition**                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| O-1   | **Shift-Left Security Integration**             | Security scans execute on every git push, before any build artifact is produced. Zero manual trigger required.                                                      |
| O-2   | **Automated Policy Enforcement Gates**          | Pipeline execution halts automatically for any finding with CVSS >= 7.0 (HIGH/CRITICAL). No human intervention needed to enforce the gate.                          |
| O-3   | **Secure Build Artifact Assurance**             | Docker images pass CIS Docker Benchmark at >= 80% compliance. Kubernetes manifests pass Checkov/Kube-score without privilege escalation violations.                 |
| O-4   | **Centralised Monitoring & Developer Feedback** | All scan findings aggregate in DefectDojo. Grafana dashboard is live. Slack notification fires within 60 seconds of any pipeline failure with remediation guidance. |

# 5\. Scope

## 5.1 In Scope

- Full 8-stage sequential CI/CD pipeline on a Java Spring Boot sample application
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI as the orchestration layer
- All security tooling listed in Section 7 (Tools & Technologies)
- Docker containerisation and Kubernetes (Helm) deployment manifests
- DefectDojo integration for centralised finding management
- Grafana + Prometheus dashboard for pipeline KPIs
- Slack webhook notifications for pipeline failures
- Documentation: this PRD, architecture diagram, tool configuration guide, and final report

## 5.2 Out of Scope

- Production cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) - sandboxed local/lab environment is sufficient
- Mobile or frontend application development
- SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response) integrations
- Custom SAST rule authoring - default rulesets of chosen tools are used
- Pen testing beyond automated DAST scope

## 5.3 Assumptions

- Team members have access to local machines capable of running Docker and Minikube
- GitHub or GitLab account is available for CI/CD pipeline hosting
- All tools used are open-source or have free tiers adequate for academic use
- The Spring Boot application used is a representative demo app (e.g., Spring PetClinic or equivalent)

# 6\. System Architecture & Pipeline Design

## 6.1 Architecture Philosophy: Sequential Security Gate Model

The pipeline is designed as a sequential gate model - analogous to an assembly line quality check, where each station must pass before the product moves forward. Unlike parallel scanning models (faster but weaker enforcement), every stage in SDOP-2025 is a blocking checkpoint. A failure at Stage 2 (SAST) terminates the pipeline immediately, preventing wasted compute and, more importantly, preventing a false sense of security from partial completion.

## 6.2 Pipeline Stages - Detailed Specification

| **Stage** | **Name**                          | **Tools**                              | **What It Checks**                                                                                       | **Gate Condition (Fail = Block)**                                            |

# 8\. Functional Requirements

## 8.1 Pipeline Trigger Requirements

- FR-01: The pipeline MUST trigger automatically on every git push to any branch
- FR-02: The pipeline MUST trigger automatically on every Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR) creation or update
- FR-03: No stage may be skipped, including for hotfix branches - all 8 stages are mandatory
- FR-04: The pipeline MUST complete all pre-build stages (1-4) before a Docker image is built

## 8.2 Security Gate Requirements

- FR-05: Stage 1 - Any secret pattern match (entropy-based or regex) MUST fail the pipeline
- FR-06: Stage 2 - SonarQube Quality Gate = FAILED status MUST fail the pipeline
- FR-07: Stage 3 - Any CVE with CVSS >= 7.0 in direct or transitive dependency MUST fail the pipeline
- FR-08: Stage 4 - Any Checkov HIGH severity IaC finding or Hadolint DL3/DL4 rule violation MUST fail the pipeline
- FR-09: Stage 5 - Docker image CIS benchmark compliance < 80% MUST fail the pipeline
  - FR-10: Stage 6 - Any OPA Rego policy DENY evaluation MUST fail the pipeline; at minimum the following policies are enforced:
  - Container must run as non-root user (UID != 0)
  - CPU and memory resource limits must be set on all containers
  - Only images from approved registries (Docker Hub official, GHCR) are permitted
- FR-11: Stage 7 - Any OWASP ZAP alert rated HIGH or CRITICAL MUST fail the pipeline

## 8.3 Reporting Requirements

- FR-12: All scan findings from all stages MUST be imported into DefectDojo automatically via API
- FR-13: Grafana dashboard MUST display: total pipeline runs, pass/fail rate, critical finding count per run, mean time to detect (MTTD), and per-stage failure frequency
- FR-14: Slack notification MUST fire within 60 seconds of any pipeline stage failure, containing: failing stage name, severity, finding summary, and link to DefectDojo finding
- FR-15: Each pipeline run MUST produce a unified HTML/JSON security report artifact downloadable from the CI/CD platform

# 9\. Non-Functional Requirements

| **Category**                   | **Metric / Target**                           | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**                | Pipeline complete in < 15 min                 | Stages 1-3 (pre-build) must complete in < 5 min to maintain developer velocity. Total pipeline target: 15 min or less.                             |
| **Reliability**                | Pipeline success rate >= 95% on clean commits | False positive rate from security tools must be low enough that the pipeline is not perceived as flaky by developers.                              |
| **Reproducibility**            | 100% reproducible builds                      | All tool versions must be pinned in configuration files. Same commit must produce identical scan results across runs.                              |
| **Security (Pipeline Itself)** | No secrets in pipeline config files           | All credentials (SonarQube tokens, Slack webhook URL, DefectDojo API key) must be stored as CI/CD secrets/environment variables - never hardcoded. |
| **Maintainability**            | Adding a new policy in < 30 min               | OPA Rego policies must be modular. Adding a new enforcement rule should require only adding a .rego file - no pipeline YAML changes.               |
| **Observability**              | Dashboard refresh < 30 sec                    | Grafana panels must reflect latest pipeline run data within 30 seconds of pipeline completion.                                                     |
| **Scalability**                | Supports >= 3 parallel PR runs                | Pipeline must not serialize on shared resources. Docker containers per stage ensure isolation and concurrency.                                     |

# 10\. Team Roles & Responsibilities

The team of four is structured around natural ownership zones, with each member responsible for one architectural layer. Cross-team code reviews are mandatory for all pipeline YAML and Rego policy files.

# 13\. Risk Register

| **Risk**                                               | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SonarQube server resource-heavy on local machine       | High           | Medium     | Use SonarCloud free tier as alternative; pre-allocate 4GB RAM for Docker host                                                                |
| OWASP ZAP scan takes too long (> 10 min for DAST)      | Medium         | High       | Configure ZAP Automation Framework with targeted context (limit scope to app routes); use ZAP Ajax Spider only for registered routes         |
| High false positive rate blocks pipeline on valid code | Medium         | High       | Week 4 dedicated false positive audit; document suppression rules with justification; use CVSS 7.0 threshold (not 4.0) to reduce noise       |
| DefectDojo API changes break import step               | Low            | Medium     | Pin DefectDojo Docker image version; test import API in Week 3 with buffer before Week 4 hardening                                           |
| Team member unavailability mid-project                 | Low            | High       | Each member documents their configuration daily in a shared Notion/README; cross-training via code review ensures no single point of failure |
| Kubernetes/Minikube environment instability            | Medium         | Medium     | Docker Compose fallback environment prepared for DAST sandbox if Minikube proves unstable; Helm charts tested on k3d as alternative          |
