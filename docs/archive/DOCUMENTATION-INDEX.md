## 🔐 GitHub Secrets You Need

```
PUSHGATEWAY_URL = http://localhost:9091
DEFECTDOJO_URL = http://localhost:8000
DEFECTDOJO_API_KEY = [your-api-key]
```

See: [QUICK-REFERENCE.md](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for exact steps

---

## 🌐 URLs to Access

```
Pushgateway:    http://localhost:9091
Prometheus:     http://localhost:9090
Grafana:        http://localhost:3000
DefectDojo:     http://localhost:8000
```

All should be accessible in your browser!

---

## ✅ Verification

### Quick Test (2 min)
```bash
bash scripts/diagnose-metrics.sh
```

### Manual Verification
1. Can you access all 4 URLs above?
2. Is Prometheus job "pushgateway" showing UP?
3. Can you query metrics in Prometheus?
4. Can you query metrics in Grafana?

---

## 📊 Expected Result

After setting up:
```
GitHub Actions → Pushgateway → Prometheus → Grafana → 📊 Metrics Displayed!
```

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**Step 1:** Run diagnostic
```bash
bash scripts/diagnose-metrics.sh
```

**Step 2:** Find your issue in this table

| Error | Doc | Solution |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Pushgateway not responding | URLS-AND-SECRETS-EXACT.md | Start Docker containers |
| Prometheus shows DOWN | METRICS-CONNECTION-DIAGRAM.md | Check container network |
| No metrics in Prometheus | STEP-BY-STEP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md | Check workflow logs |
| Grafana won't connect | URLS-AND-SECRETS-EXACT.md | Use internal DNS name |
| HTTP 400 error | METRICS-FORMAT-FIX.md | Already fixed, update scripts |

**Step 3:** Read the indicated document
